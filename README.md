TiddlyWiki's source code is split up into a number of separate files which are then joined together using the [TiddlyWiki5](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5) command line tool to produce a single HTML file.

The scripts used to test and build TiddlyWiki for publication at tiddlywiki.com can be found at [https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/tiddlywiki.com/](https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/tiddlywiki.com/).
