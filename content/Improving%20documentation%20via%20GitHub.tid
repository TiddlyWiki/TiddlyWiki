title: Improving documentation via GitHub
type: text/x-tiddlywiki

Anyone can suggest improvements to the documentation. Since it is [[built|https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyWiki/blob/master/build/README.md]] from separate .tid content [[files|https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyWiki/tree/master/content]] stored in the {{{TiddlyWiki}}} [[GitHub repository|https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyWiki]], proposing changes is done via ~GitHub too. Here's how:
# Create an account on https://github.com if you don't already have one. /%#
	to adapt:
# Sign the [[Contributor License Agreement|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Contributor%20License%20Agreement]] as described in [[Signing the Contributor License Agreement|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Signing%20the%20Contributor%20License%20Agreement]].
%/
# For the tiddler you want to improve, locate its .tid file either by clicking from the "suggest changes" button or directly within the [[content|https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyWiki/tree/master/content]] folder.
# Click the pencil edit icon to make changes to the file. ~GitHub will prompt you to write the file into your personal fork of the repository. Later you will need to create a pull request in the {{{TiddlyWiki}}} [[GitHub repository|https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyWiki]] to merge your changes.
** A "fork" is your personal copy of the repository including the changes you are proposing.
** Ensure to adjust the modified field with a date time stamp in {{{YYYYMMDDHHMM}}} format and the modifier field with your username.
# Below the edit box for the tiddler text you should see a box labeled ''Propose file change''.
# Enter a brief title to explain the change, prefixed with "docs:" (eg, "docs: add examples of the slider macro usage").
# If necessary, enter a longer description too.
# Click the green button labeled ''Propose file change''.
# On the following screen, click the green button labeled ''Create pull request''.
One of the core developers will review your pull request and merge it so it will be incorporated into main repository.
/%# describe also:
* aspects of edit beyond the first one, branch names and updating master in the fork
* split.recipe and how to propose renaming, deleting or adding a tiddler
