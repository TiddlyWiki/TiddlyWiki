There are several ways that you can have your TiddlyWiki data hosted online, making it easier to access and share your information.

!~TiddlySpot
[<img[//tiddlyspot.com/_ts/images/banner-logo.png][TiddlySpot|http://tiddlyspot.com]] ~TiddlySpot lets you put TiddlyWiki documents on the Web, and edit them directly in your browser. It doesn't yet offer full support for simultaneous editing by multiple users.

!~DropBox
Many people use [[DropBox|http://dropbox.com]] to synchronise their TiddlyWiki documents to make them available on multiple computers. The ~DropBox iPhone/iPad application also permits read only access to TiddlyWiki documents. See [[A Personal Knowledgebase Solution: Tiddlywiki and Dropbox|http://www.broowaha.com/articles/7671/a-personal-knowledgebase-solution-tiddlywiki-and-dropbox]]

!~TiddlyWeb & ~TiddlySpace
[[TiddlyWeb|http://tiddlyweb.com]] is a flexible architecture for putting tiddlers on the web. On top of it ~TiddlySpace was created in 2010 by the Osmosoft team at BT, and generously operated for the community by them and their successors until December 9th 2016.

[<img[TiddlySpace|./images/shinyspace.png][http://tiddlyspace.com]] [[TiddlySpace|http://tiddlyspace.com]] was a full hosted service for TiddlyWiki that allowed multiple people to edit the same wiki at the same time. It was particularly focused on sharing tiddlers.

!TiddlyWiki Server for node.js (TWS)
[[TWS|https://github.com/PoulStaugaard/TWS]] by Poul Staugaard is a simple node.js based serverside for TiddlyWiki.

!~GieWiki
[[GieWiki|http://code.google.com/p/giewiki/]] by Poul Staugaard is a new serverside for TiddlyWiki that focusses on making TiddlyWiki behave like a real wiki, with preview and versioning of tiddlers, any number of pages in any hierachy, an auto-generated sitemap, comments on tiddlers, fine-grained access control, image upload, recent changes etc. You can see a default instance at http://giewiki.appspot.com/.

!ccTiddly
[[ccTiddly|http://tiddlywiki.org/#ccTiddly]] is an older serverside written in PHP to use [[MySQL|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL]] for storage. It is no longer under active development, but remains a popular choice for basic TiddlyWiki hosting needs.

!~TiddlyCouch
[[TiddlyCouch|http://bijl.iriscouch.com/bijl-ctw/_design/tiddlycouch/_list/tiddlywiki/tiddlers]] is an experimental integration of TiddlyWiki with CouchDB.
